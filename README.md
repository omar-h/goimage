## Getting Started
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/omar-h/goimage/releases) for your platform, and extract the files.

Create a config.json file in the root directory:
```JSON
{
    "port": 8080,
    "secure": false,
    "32-byte-auth-key": "62caed6a7842b5470c2e89693f92c9bab01219f8ebc0c9c0785b97cfd7a68187",
    "allowed-mime-types": [
        "image/x-icon",
        "image/jpeg",
        "image/pjpeg",
        "image/png",
        "image/tiff",
        "image/x-tiff",
        "image/webp",
        "image/gif"
    ],
    "allowed-extensions": [
        ".png",
        ".jpeg",
        ".jpg",
        ".jiff",
        ".png",
        ".ico",
        ".gif",
        ".tif",
        ".webp"
    ],
    "image-name-length": 4,
    "max-file-size": 30000000,
    "image-directory": "public/i/",
    "template-directory": "templates/",
    "public-directory": "public/",
    "image-url": "/i/",
    "csrf": false
}
```

Then run the program.
For Linux, in a terminal window, you would run:
```BASH
$ ./goimage
```
On a Windows machine, you would open a command prompt window, and run:
```BASH
C:\goimage-folder> goimage.exe
```

## Benchmarks
Coming soon..

## Running from Source
You can do this two ways; either by using go get, or git clone.

**Not recommended for production use.**

Note: Requires Go installed on the system.

**Git Clone**

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/Omar-H/goimage.git
cd goimage/
go run main.go
```

**Go Get**
